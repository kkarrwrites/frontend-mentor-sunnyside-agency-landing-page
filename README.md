# Frontend Mentor Sunnyside Agency Landing Page

I wrote this in VS Code (1.7.1.2) and tested it in Firefox (104.0.2).

There is one break point at 62.5em (1000px); below this threshold, the mobile view appears with the hamburger menu, which functions with JavaScript.

In Chrome (105.0.5195.127), the styling for the SVGs in the footer (the logo and social media icons) do not appear as they should, so please view the deployment in Firefox. I will address this issue at a later date hopefully, but if anyone has any insights into why this has occurred, I would appreciate it.
